# Jesper's dotfiles

This is Jesper Karsrud's dotfiles, with awesome stuff in it!

## How does it work?

`git clone` into `~/.dotfiles` and run `sh bootstrap.sh`. 

Mind you, if you have your own `.gitconfig`, you might want to back it up before you run the bootstrap script, as it overwrites stuff.

If you only want specific things, you could always just `cp` the files you want.

## TODO:

Make a build file that can take some config options
